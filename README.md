**Data Collection**
Use [coingecko open source API](url) to extract open, high, low, closing (ohlc) prices of digital currencies from the past 60 days as training data?...
Utilize the same method to extract test data (from Mar - April) as testing data??

**Building the Model**
- Time series forecasting models: LSTM / ARIMA to predict prices?(or is it automatically update prices once validation data comes in everyday)
